        <h2>what are Altcoins?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Tokens, cryptocurrencies, and other types of digital assets that are not bitcoin are collectively known as
            alternative cryptocurrencies, typically shortened to "altcoins" or "alt coins". Paul
            Vigna of The Wall Street Journal also described altcoins as "alternative versions of bitcoin" given its
            role as the model protocol for altcoin designers. The term is commonly used to describe coins and tokens
            created after bitcoin. A list of some cryptocurrencies can be found in the List of cryptocurrencies article.</p>

        <p>Altcoins often have underlying differences with bitcoin. For example, Litecoin aims to process a block every
            2.5 minutes, rather than bitcoin's 10 minutes, which allows Litecoin to confirm transactions faster than
            bitcoin. Another example is Ethereum, which has smart contract functionality that allows decentralized
            applications to be run on its blockchain. Ethereum was the most used blockchain in 2020, according to
            Bloomberg News. In 2016, it had the largest "following" of any altcoin, according to the New York
            Times.</p>

        <p>Significant rallies across altcoin markets are often referred to as an "altseason"</p>
