        <h2>What is Bitcoin ?</h2>
        <div id="bitcoin"></div>
        <p>Bitcoin (â‚¿) is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent
            from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are
            verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.
            The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi
            Nakamoto. The currency began use in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source
            software.</p>
    
        <p>Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies,
            products, and services, but the real-world value of the coins is extremely volatile. Research produced
            by the University of Cambridge estimated that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a
            cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.</p>
    
        <p>Bitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal transactions, the large amount of electricity (and thus
            carbon footprint) used by mining, price volatility, and thefts from exchanges. Some economists and commentators
            have characterized it as a speculative bubble at various times. Bitcoin has also been used as an investment,
            although several regulatory agencies have issued investor alerts about bitcoin.</p>
    
        <p>The word bitcoin was defined in a white paper published on 31 October 2008. It is a compound of the words
            bit and coin. No uniform convention for bitcoin capitalization exists; some sources use Bitcoin,
            capitalized, to refer to the technology and network and bitcoin, lowercase, for the unit of account. The
            Wall Street Journal, The Chronicle of Higher Education, and the Oxford English Dictionary advocate
            the use of lowercase bitcoin in all cases. </p>
