        <h2>What is a Cryptocurrency?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a binary data designed to work as a medium of exchange
            wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized
            database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional
            coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain
            the cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral. In return, they get
            authority over the token in proportion to the amount they stake. Generally, these token stakers get
            additional ownership in the token over time via network fees, newly minted tokens or other such reward
            mechanisms. Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued
            by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to a central bank
            digital currency (CBDC). When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a
            single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each
            cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public
            financial transaction database</p>

        <h2>What is a blokchain?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using
            cryptography. It's also described as a "trustless and fully decentralized peer-to-peer immutable
            data storage" that is spread over a network of participants often referred to as nodes. Each block
            contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally
            represented as a Merkle tree). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was
            published in order to get into its hash. As blocks each contain information about the block previous to it,
            they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it. Therefore, blockchains are
            resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered
            retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.</p>

        <p>Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer network for use as a publicly distributed ledger, where
            nodes collectively adhere to a protocol to communicate and validate new blocks. Although blockchain records
            are not unalterable as forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a
            distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.</p>

        <p>The blockchain was invented by a person (or group of people) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to
            serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto
            remains unknown to date. The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to
            solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin
            design has inspired other applications and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely
            used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain is considered a type of payment rail.Private blockchains have
            been proposed for business use but Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized blockchains without
            a proper security model "snake oil".However, others have argued that permissioned blockchains, if
            carefully designed, may be more decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than permissionless
            ones.</p>
